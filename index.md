I am an Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. As an economist in the Research Department, I provide policy support by examining salient developments and risks in banking and financial markets. My research interests span the union of two fields - Econometrics and Financial Economics. 

My <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fEPvMO6Q-85TENKHmICg60m-BT_CtEV/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">recent working paper</a> with Blake Marsh examines the effects of the PPP on bank balance sheets and profitability. We show through counterfactual analysis that a credit crunch would have ensued in the absence of the program. 

In <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nxJe7RI9TxIAs7UxJjmDuNqgMk2Pto1u" target="_blank">other recent research</a>, I have developed a new Bayesian estimation method for latent class models to evaluate the performance of the FDIC and the FSLIC during the simultaneous crises in the banking and the Savings and Loans industries. I show that the FDIC's decisions were consistent with, and the FSLIC deviated from optimal resolution rules from theoretical studies.   

I completed my PhD in Economics from the University of California at Irvine in June 2019.

Protections from Firm Safety Nets </a>

We quantify the effects of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) on bank balance sheets and profitability by addressing two levels of selection effects that are typically overlooked in the literature. We explicitly model banks' decisions regarding whether, and by how much to participate in the program. We find that banks that disbursed larger shares of PPP loans relative to their loan base experienced sizable growth in their lending, but a decline in their interest margins, and no measurable effects on risk-taking. Notably, in counterfactual exercises, we find that the PPP averted a credit crunch by offsetting a large potential contraction in business lending. Moreover, we find salient selection effects--lenders with greater funding capacity and at higher risk of losses from exposure to business loans were more likely to participate in the program, and to participate more intensively. These results suggest that in the absence of federal guarantees, banks would have been unlikely to risk their own capital and meet the credit needs of firms during the pandemic.

During banking crises, the public criticizes regulators for bailouts or liquidations of specific banks. A comprehensive assessment of regulators, however, requires examining all their decisions against regulators' objectives of preserving financial stability while discouraging moral hazard. I develop a Bayesian latent class model to assess regulators on these competing objectives and evaluate banking and savings and loan (S & L) regulators during the 1980's crises. I find the banking authority (FDIC) conformed to these objectives whereas the S & L regulator (FSLIC), which subsequently became insolvent, deviated from them. Timely interventions based on this evaluation could have redressed the FSLIC's decision structure and prevented losses to taxpayers.


<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27733" target="_blank"> Payments Crises and Consequences (with Qian Chen, Christoffer Koch, and Gary Richardson, NBER Working Paper 27733) </a>

Banking-system shutdowns during contractions scar economies. Four times in the last forty years, governors suspended payments from state-insured depository institutions. Suspensions of payments in Nebraska (1983), Ohio (1985), and Maryland (1985), which were short and occurred during expansions, had little measurable impact on macroeconomic aggregates. Rhode Island’s payments crisis (1991), which was prolonged and occurred during a recession, lengthened and deepened the downturn. Unemployment increased. Output declined, possibly permanently relative to what might have been. We document these effects using a novel Bayesian method for synthetic control that characterizes the principal types of uncertainty in this form of analysis. Our findings suggest policies that ensure banks continue to process payments during contractions – including the bailouts of financial institutions in 2008 and the unprecedented support of the financial system during the COVID crisis – have substantial value.

This paper examines the moral hazard effects of lax regulatory and resolution standards on thrift institutions during the Savings and Loans crisis. I make use of the natural policy experiment arising from the closure of the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) in 1989 and the ensuing regime of stringent regulation of thrift institutions. The paper develops a Bayesian method for causal inference by incorporating the difference-in-difference strategy into the potential outcome framework. I find that thrifts facing a high probability of failure increase their composition of safe assets and reduce the share of high-risk loans on their balance sheets relative to thrifts at a low probability of failure following the policy change. These results provide evidence of moral hazard incentives in the thrift industry prior to the introduction of enhanced regulation and oversight in 1989. The shift to safe assets is observed primarily among stock thrifts relative to mutual thrifts, showing evidence of risk-shifting from equity-holders of stock thrifts toward debt-holders prior to regulatory reforms.  In the light of the Orderly Liquidation Authority under the Dodd-Frank Act that signals the unavailability of public assistance to financial institutions in the event of failure, this paper demonstrates that the internalization of such signals by shareholders will be crucial for the policy to succeed in its intended aim of curbing moral hazard effects associated with the expectation of public assistance.

This paper develops an econometric method to determine the presence of household-level heterogeneity in relationships between consumer expectations, that are typically recorded as ordered responses in consumer surveys, and household demographic characteristics. This method extends the hierarchical Bayesian algorithm developed by Chen and Dunson (2003) for continuous outcomes and draws on the informational value of the presence of random coefficients, namely, as evidence in favor of heterogeneity in relationships between the outcome and explanatory variables. The algorithm selects covariates that have random coefficients associated with them by exploring the model space of all possible combinations of random coefficients. This study provides a framework for computing overall marginal effects that combine the fixed and random effects of each coefficient using output from the estimation algorithm. The application of this method on data from the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that for the same change in income category and health status, households adjust their expectation of financial position and credit access differently. These findings demonstrate the intrinsic heterogeneity in household-level models for forming expectations and support the increasing focus on incorporating heterogeneity of expectations within macroeconomic models.
