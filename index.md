I am an Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. I completed my PhD in Economics from the University of California at Irivne in June 2019. My research interests span the union of two fields - Econometrics and Financial Economics and involve the development of Econometric methods that address research questions pertaining to banking and financial stability. 

 
__Research Interests__: Econometrics, Financial Economics, Computational Statistics and Macroeconomics

During banking crises, the public criticizes regulators for bailouts or liquidations of specific banks. A comprehensive assessment of regulators, however, requires examining all their decisions against regulators' objectives of preserving financial stability while discouraging moral hazard. I develop a Bayesian latent class model to assess regulators on these competing objectives and evaluate banking and savings and loan (S & L) regulators during the 1980's crises. I find the banking authority (FDIC) conformed to these objectives whereas the S & L regulator (FSLIC), which subsequently became insolvent, deviated from them. Timely interventions based on this evaluation could have redressed the FSLIC's decision structure and prevented losses to taxpayers.


<a href="https://https://www.nber.org/papers/w27733" target="_blank"> Payments Crises and Consequences (with Qian Chen, Christoffer Koch, and Gary Richardson, NBER Working Paper 27733) </a>

Banking-system shutdowns during contractions scar economies. Four times in the last forty years, governors suspended payments from state-insured depository institutions. Suspensions of payments in Nebraska (1983), Ohio (1985), and Maryland (1985), which were short and occurred during expansions, had little measurable impact on macroeconomic aggregates. Rhode Island’s payments crisis (1991), which was prolonged and occurred during a recession, lengthened and deepened the downturn. Unemployment increased. Output declined, possibly permanently relative to what might have been. We document these effects using a novel Bayesian method for synthetic control that characterizes the principal types of uncertainty in this form of analysis. Our findings suggest policies that ensure banks continue to process payments during contractions – including the bailouts of financial institutions in 2008 and the unprecedented support of the financial system during the COVID crisis – have substantial value.

This paper examines the moral hazard effects of lax regulatory and resolution standards on thrift institutions during the Savings and Loans crisis. I make use of the natural policy experiment arising from the closure of the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) in 1989 and the ensuing regime of stringent regulation of thrift institutions. The paper develops a Bayesian method for causal inference by incorporating the difference-in-difference strategy into the potential outcome framework. I find that thrifts facing a high probability of failure increase their composition of safe assets and reduce the share of high-risk loans on their balance sheets relative to thrifts at a low probability of failure following the policy change. These results provide evidence of moral hazard incentives in the thrift industry prior to the introduction of enhanced regulation and oversight in 1989. The shift to safe assets is observed primarily among stock thrifts relative to mutual thrifts, showing evidence of risk-shifting from equity-holders of stock thrifts toward debt-holders prior to regulatory reforms.  In the light of the Orderly Liquidation Authority under the Dodd-Frank Act that signals the unavailability of public assistance to financial institutions in the event of failure, this paper demonstrates that the internalization of such signals by shareholders will be crucial for the policy to succeed in its intended aim of curbing moral hazard effects associated with the expectation of public assistance.

This paper develops an econometric method to determine the presence of household-level heterogeneity in relationships between consumer expectations, that are typically recorded as ordered responses in consumer surveys, and household demographic characteristics. This method extends the hierarchical Bayesian algorithm developed by Chen and Dunson (2003) for continuous outcomes and draws on the informational value of the presence of random coefficients, namely, as evidence in favor of heterogeneity in relationships between the outcome and explanatory variables. The algorithm selects covariates that have random coefficients associated with them by exploring the model space of all possible combinations of random coefficients. This study provides a framework for computing overall marginal effects that combine the fixed and random effects of each coefficient using output from the estimation algorithm. The application of this method on data from the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that for the same change in income category and health status, households adjust their expectation of financial position and credit access differently. These findings demonstrate the intrinsic heterogeneity in household-level models for forming expectations and support the increasing focus on incorporating heterogeneity of expectations within macroeconomic models.
